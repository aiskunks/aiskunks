##  GenAI: Bridging the Gap for Aspiring Developers 

**Ideation:** Imagine an app that empowers you, the recent graduate, by:

* **Generating tailored starter code** for projects, leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI.
* **Automatically creating a GitHub repository** with your chosen tech stack, ready to showcase your skills to potential employers.

**This is GenAI!**

**Under the Hood:**

* **LLM-Powered Code Generation:** Our trained LLM draws on a vast dataset of code examples to create well-structured and functional code, adapting to your coding style and preferences.
* **Project Refinement:**
    * **1. Company Tech Stack:** Enter a company name, and GenAI reveals its technology stack.
    * **2. Project Generation:** Input your desired tech stack, and GenAI suggests relevant projects to showcase your skills.
    * **3. GitHub Starter Code:** Select a project, and GenAI generates well-formatted starter code directly in your new GitHub repository.
    * **4. EDA Feature:** Get AI-assisted guidance on exploratory data analysis, with a dedicated Git repository for your data project.

**Effortless GitHub Integration:**

GenAI seamlessly integrates with the GitHub API to:

* **Create a new repository** with your chosen name and description.
* **Add a comprehensive README file** outlining your project details.
* **Make an initial commit** with the generated starter code.


**Together, let's bridge the gap for aspiring developers and empower them to showcase their skills with confidence!**
