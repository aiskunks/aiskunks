# AI Skunkworks - What We Have Done?

AI Skunks is an experiential AI playground whose mission is to use technology and AI to teach research, creativity, and entrepreneurial thinking and skills.

Experiential AI is learning AI by doing AI. Experiential learning is the process of learning by doing. By engaging in hands-on experiences and reflection, people learn how to apply knowledge to real-world situations.

Mentorship is critical for experiential learning. The primary purpose of AI Skunkworks is to connect more experienced AI nerds with those less experienced and have them work on open-source code, tutorials, or writing articles.

*Klee - An open-source procedural AI engine*

Visual procedural programming allows for very rapid, highly performant and iterative programming making it a great acrhitecture for machine learning and MLOPs. Node-based programming can be mixed with scripting.

This style of programming has been proven in VFX and game engines like SideFX Houdini, Unity 3D, and Unreal Engine. Games like Fortnite are almost entirely built using visual programming.

This software architecture allows data scientists, biologists, reseachers, Kagglers and anyone interested in developing custom AI applications to be far more effective than they would be writing lots of scripts and notebooks.

 ## Biology  
 
 Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard Collaboration
 
 Tangram is a Python package, written in PyTorch and based on scanpy, for mapping single-cell (or single-nucleus) gene expression data onto spatial gene expression data. The single-cell dataset and the spatial dataset should be collected from the same anatomical region/tissue type, ideally from a biological replicate, and need to share a set of genes. Tangram aligns the single-cell data in space by fitting gene expression on the shared genes.

*Estimation of diffusion parameters from under-sampled measurements with deep learning*  

Parameters inferred from the diffusion signal measured at every voxel in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, such as mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, reflect upon tissue characteristics and are, therefore, used in many clinical applications. We would like to explore deep learning methods and develop solutions to estimate these parameters from a small number of measurements, to shorten the patient scan times and enable such analyses in vulnerable patient populations such as fetuses, and pediatric patients who cannot stay still in the MRI scanner for long imaging sessions.

*Automatic image quality assessment and brain segmentation in diffusion-weighted images*   

Real-time assessment of the quality of diffusion-weighted images is very important. Segmentation of the brain in these images is also necessary and very challenging due to complex image intensity variations. We seek methods that can accomplish these accurately and in real-time.

*Deep learning-based estimation of fiber orientation distribution from diffusion-weighted MRI*  

Existing methods for estimating brain fiber orientations use mathematical models that are based on the physics of the diffusion process. We seek machine-learning-based methods that avoid relying on such models, which can be sub-optimal or even wrong.

*Fetal and newborn brain tract segmentation using deep learning*   

Segmentation of major brain white matter tracts is essential in studying brain development and degeneration. The common methods to accomplish this task involve complex multi-step procedure. We would like to explore the potential of deep learning to replace these complex pipelines.

## Finance   

*The Economics of Happiness*   

The idea is to annotate countries with as many economic indicators as possible and use that to predict the World Happiness Report scores for various years.

Since 2002, the World Happiness Report has used statistical analysis to determine the world's happiest countries https://worldhappiness.report/

The WHR data is at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness

We will then use EDA, models, and model interpretability to determine which factors contribute the most to predicting the Happiness Score

The initial focus of **Regenerative AI** is focused on making career changes. We are looking for people to write papers, and build open-source tools focused on careers. These might be tools that help students from preparing their CV or to getting matched with the perfect job.

## Ideas

Ideas are thoughts for project/paper ideas should a Skunk or group of Skunks want to write a paper.Reach out if you would like to do any of these projects.

*RAMAN Effect Project*   
Nik Bear Brown, Shesh Gupta
 
The RAMAN Effect project is research to develop machine learning and experiments to show the effectiveness of RAMAN SERS for wastewater epidemiology rather than a technology like PCR.


RAMAN SERS versus PCR
 
Wastewater collection is at some facility such as a dorm, office building, apartment building, naval ship, prison, or nursing home. PCR is a well-established molecular biology technique that only detects known nucleic acids. PCR is better at detecting presence or absence than being a strictly quantitative technique. The PCR test takes a sample of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and “amplifies” it with the help of lab technologies. Amplifying RNA helps to make even small traces of the COVID-19 virus visible in the test sample. Even if you have a small trace of the .virus in your system, the PCR test will detect it.  PCR technology is not sensitive. As one can see from PCR based wastewater testing company BioBots publications their tiers are fairly broad that covers four orders of magnitude to classify data.
 
The PCR approach has a number of serious issues. The primary issue is that if one is going to test the wastewater at a facility one wants to test for many more things than COVID-19. The set of substances of interest will heavily depend on the demographic. For example, in a dorm or a naval ship testing for recreational drugs and STDs is a more important epidemiological question than testing for COVID. For a nursing home testing for the flu and prescription drugs is important.
 
Another approach would be to use High Performance Liquid Chromatography. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), formerly referred to as high-pressure liquid chromatography, is a technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture.  HPLC is the gold standard for accuracy but is expensive and would require mailing samples to a lab. 
 
The most natural technique for wastewater epidemiology is Raman Spectroscopy. Raman Spectroscopy is a non-destructive chemical analysis technique which provides detailed information about chemical structure, phase and polymorphy, crystallinity and molecular interactions. It is based upon the interaction of light with the chemical bonds within a material.
 
In Raman Spectroscopy, a sample is illuminated with a laser beam. Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the laser line (Rayleigh scattering) is filtered out by either a notch filter, edge pass filter, or a band pass filter, while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector such as a camera.
 
Raman Spectroscopy can be very cheap. It can detect bacteria, small molecules and nucleic acids. Raman Spectrometers have been built using a cell phone and a diode laser.
 
To enhance the detection of molecules, Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) is typically used. Despite extensive efforts to protect public health, disease outbreaks still occur when toxic chemicals and microbial threats evade detection. Peanut butter and produce tainted with Escherichia coli 0157:H7, have polluted drinking water in Milwaukee, WI. In Walkerton, ON (Canada) has been polluted by Cryptosporidium. In many other places surface waters contaminated by cyanotoxins, or mail laced with anthrax spores each represent an outbreak that could have been prevented by a combination of RAMAN with SERS had it been in place. PCR cannot detect E. Coli, Cryptosporidium, cyanotoxins or anthrax. Nor can it detect drugs like opioids. These outbreaks may have been prevented with faster and more readily available pathogen or chemical detection methods such as RAMAN with SERS.  SERS has been used to detect contaminants at femtomolar concentrations over practical time scales. SERS is also capable of simultaneously detecting multiple contaminants of varying polarities and molecular weights, a feat that most existing detection strategies cannot achieve. SERS chips are wafers with nanoparticles with different areas of the chip to detect specific moleclues. Chips are about the size of a sim card can detect around 100 different molecules.

## Testimonials



Professor Brown and AI Skunkworks has been an immense backing for the students in the Data track, this support has made me a data scientist. and was a game-changer.

Ai Skunkwokrs uses different projects for students to get experience from real-world problems and he was the true champion of experiential learning. These projects like this provide a good experience for oneself to build the portfolio for showcasing during full-time interviews.

AI skunkworks instills and develops AI thinking among the students. This also gave students like me a platform to express myself and develop my leadership skills and managerial skills apart from giving me the opportunity to improve my data science skills.

AI Skunkworks has helped me bridge the gap between starting off as a Novice in the field of AI to implementing real challenges in AI in industry. Prof. Nik's mentoring, constant encouragement and AI skunkworks involvement in networking helped me in working with Squark AI on productionizing best data scrubbing techniques. The efforts of Prof. Nik's mentoring and collaboration with fellow students in the research group has helped my Article titled 'Comparison of Performance of Data Imputation Techniques' get selected for presentation at RISE 2022, Northeastern University.  I say it's time that AI Skunkworks be called an Impact engine because it definitely lives up to that title.
